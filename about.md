# About the Event

The "AI methods for mental health monitoring" AI UK 2024 Fringe Event is a joint initiative by the Alan Turing Institute's "Data Science for Mental Health" and "Natural Language Processing" Interest Groups. Our goal is to bring together academics and industry professionals to explore and discuss the latest AI methods for monitoring and improving mental health.

This event is an excellent opportunity for participants to:

- Showcase their research and projects through poster or demo presentations.
- Network with peers and experts in the fields of AI, NLP, and mental health.
- Learn about the latest trends and challenges in applying AI to mental health monitoring.

We believe in the power of interdisciplinary collaboration to advance our understanding and capabilities in mental health care. Join us in central London or online for a day of insightful talks, valuable networking, and collaborative learning.
